    Display abstract socket names correctly

    Because names start with NUL, display '@' followed by 2nd name char onwards.
    Also take care not to display more characters than actual name length.
    (Required for verbose listener when client has shorter abstract name than
    previous client).

    nc: do not test the connection in non-interactive mode

    The connection test writes four X to the socket, which corrupts data
    that we may want to pipe into nc. So don't do that if stdin is not a

    Make AF_UNIX UDP sockets behave more like IP ones

    IP client and single-shot server instances have always exited after sending
    a UDP message to a peer that has disappeared.
    AF_UNIX instances would just hang around, not reading from STDIN.
    The difference was that AF_UNIX write() gets an error when peer has gone but
    IP write() succeeds, with POLLERR showing up in the next poll(),
    triggering exit.
    Multi-shot AF_UNIX listeners (-k option) would show data from new clients
    but couldn't respond because they had also stopped reading STDIN.
    The single-shotters now exit on network write error while multi-shot server
    makes it look like error never happened.

    Delete temporary AF_UNIX socket on exit

    There was code to delete the AF_UNIX socket of a client whether temporary or
    not but this relied on readwrite() returning.
    Some recent enhancements can make readwrite() exit directly
    e.g. -q0 then ^D, so make sure to at least delete a socket in /tmp.
    With the signal handler introduced in 3569cd0e, the socket is
    also deleted on control-C.

    The quit() function had the wrong signature for a signal handler: fix.

    Quit timer (Debian patch, updated)

    This is the Debian quit timer patch, but with -q option re-worked.

    -N only does a shutdown of net out, as it used to.
    In the case of a tcp -N client and server w/out -k,
    client ^D causes the server to shut down due to an asymmetry in the code.
    Server shutdown then causes the client to shut down.
    This is the only case where -N appears to operate like -q0.

    Implementation detail:
    there is a new ctrld_seen flag to explicitly record ^D (or end of file).
