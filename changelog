    Use -s/-p flags to specify listen address (Debian patch)
    
    The patch is somewhat modified because of openbsd changes
    between 1.206 & 1.217.
    
    In particular, they removed uport = NULL and host = NULL,
    so the updated patch does not reinstate them.

    Quit timer (Debian patch, updated)
    
    This is the Debian quit timer patch, but with -q option re-worked.
    
    -N only does a shutdown of net out, as it used to.
    In the case of a tcp -N client and server w/out -k,
    client ^D causes the server to shut down due to an asymmetry in the code.
    Server shutdown then causes the client to shut down.
    This is the only case where -N appears to operate like -q0.
    
    Implementation detail:
    there is a new ctrld_seen flag to explicitly record ^D (or end of file).

    Connect timeout (Debian patch, updated)
    
    This is the Debian connect timeout patch to use select's ability to
    update its timeout arg after EINTR.
    Connect error reporting is re-worked in line with the OpenBSD update.
    The no-longer-used timeout_connect() function is removed.

    Server UDP nc with -k sends message to most recent client
    
    (Prior to this, standard input was effectively discarded).
    
    -k -l -u -v reports each time a message comes from a different client
    than the previous message came from.

    Rather than reporting everything as "on" report e.g.
    "Connection received from", "Bound to" and so on.

    Only force fd's to -1 once
    
    The motivation for this is to make debug logs less confusing.
    
    All changed lines have previously demonstrated the problem.
